https://finshots.in/markets/the-changing-face-of-hdfc-life-the-insurance-industry/,The changing face of HDFC life & the Insurance industry,HDFC,"Life insurance products have been synonymous with LIC since time immemorial. But ever since the government opened up the industry to private players, a lot of companies have been making considerable headway. And perhaps one of the leading players in the recent past has been HDFC Life — a company that’s focused on selling long-term life insurance products. So today we thought we’ll look at how the industry is shaping up and HDFC Life’s place in the ecosystem.
Understanding the fundamentals
Insurance works because of risk pooling. It is one of the fundamental building blocks of the industry. A risk pool involves a group of people coming together (prompted by an insurer) to pool small amounts of money to cover those who might need money in the event of a catastrophe. Think — Death or a debilitating disease. And as more people enter the risk pool, insurance companies try to cover high-risk individuals by sharing costs and potential exposure more evenly across the board.
However, insurers still have to make sure that the fee they collect from each customer will allow them to honour their obligations. This is a function of the insurer’sunderwriting capabilitiesi.e. their ability to gauge risk and price their policies accurately. If they get this bit right, then they can go about pursuing more customers in a bid to keep expanding that risk pool.
And this begets thedistribution challenge. How do you convince people they need insurance? Specifically, term insurance. The product doesn’t protect you per se. But it does protect those around in the event of your untimely death — By way of making a large payout so that your family can deal with the added financial burden despite your absence.
Unfortunately, for most people thinking about death and insurance can be extremely challenging. In fact, most people in India buy insurance products because they have a pushy uncle who happens to be an agent or they’re trying to save on taxes. So, if you’re a company trying to create and sell insurance products, your biggest challenge is to market it.
Now HDFC Life has traditionally skirted around this problem by leveraging the large network of HDFC bank in this country. They have been able to cross-sell their insurance products in these banking channels (also called bancassurance) and this avenue has been the primary driver of growth for the company — contributing almost 75% of the sales in FY16. And although they are no longer as reliant on these channels anymore (with the growing influence of direct sales and online partners), it’s still the biggest distribution channel for the company contributing about 55% of the sales in FY20.
But then, insurance companies found another workaround. They changed the composition of the insurance product in a bid to make it more enticing. And the most infamous product within the lot is aULIP(Unit Linked Insurance Product). Think of ULIPs as part insurance, part investment products. A small chunk of the premium is allocated towards providing you with an insurance cover (decent payout in case you do die). And the remaining funds are invested in stocks and bonds. Eventually, at the end of the payment cycle i.e. maturity (say 10 years), you will be paid the final investment corpus so long as you are alive at the time. Meaning, you don’t have to die to gain from your insurance policy making it very appealing to the average Joe.
Now most prudent financial planners will tell you ULIPs aren’t particularly useful. The cover is insufficient to really help your family in case catastrophe strikes and the investment bit won’t yield outsized returns considering that a sizeable part of your premium is deducted before they’re invested. For instance, there is the premium allocation charge, the fund management fee, some random commission, admin fees and eventually once everyone’s taken their cut, the insurance company will park the remaining funds in a mix of stocks and bonds. But despite this sub-optimal allocation, customers always seem to think they’re getting a bargain. And the agents selling these products make sure of it.
But here’s the funny thing. Despite their popularity, ULIPs aren’t high margin products. In the long run, insurance companies are likely to make better margins via stand-alone life insurance products. So technically, HDFC Life has every reason to keep selling those pure protection policies, even if they are hard to sell. And while the company did focus on ULIPs at one point in time, there is a discernible shift in strategy. Share of ULIPs in the new business has dropped from 56% in FY16 to just 28% in FY20, whereas term insurance plans have increased from 5% in FY16 to 11% in FY20.
And guess what — The pandemic might only further reinforce this conviction.
Now bear in mind, it’s not been very rosy for insurance companies since coronavirus made landfall. After all, insurance is a push product and the lockdown impacted the movement of agents and customer walk-ins. Ultimately premiums earned from sellingnew policies fell by 25–30%for the entire industry. Meanwhile, insurers were also having to deal withfalling persistency levelsi.e. the number of people persisting with their premium payments beyond a certain time frame. There’s an obvious decline here considering the threat of job loss and income depression. However, on the bright side, protection plans have been the least affected. In fact, there’s anincreasing demand for term insurance policiespresumably since more people finally seem to understand the utility of a pure protection product.
new policies fell by 25–30%
falling persistency levels
increasing demand for term insurance policies
And therefore optimists argue that HDFC Life is best poised to leverage this opportunity considering they’ve been focusing on pure-play products for a while now. In fact, new business premium growth for the company in August and September tallied up to 44% and 55% respectively — highest among its public competitors. So could all this explain why the company commands a premium (in the stock market) compared to their listed peers?
What do you think?
Do you think there’s a clear frontrunner in the industry or is insurance just too complicated to figure out?

The Story
Insurance works because of risk pooling. It is one of the fundamental building blocks of the industry. A risk pool involves a group of people coming together (prompted by an insurer) to pool small amounts of money to cover those who might need money in the event of a catastrophe. Like Death for instance.
Unfortunately, for most people thinking about death and insurance can be extremely challenging. In fact, most people in India buy insurance products because they have a pushy uncle who happens to be an agent or they’re trying to save on taxes. So, if you’re a company trying to create and sell insurance products, your biggest challenge is to market them.
But then, insurance companies found another workaround. They changed the composition of the insurance product in a bid to make it more enticing. And the most infamous product within the lot is aULIP(Unit Linked Insurance Product). Think of ULIPs as part insurance, part investment products. A small chunk of the premium is allocated towards providing you with an insurance cover (decent payout in case you do die). And the remaining funds are invested in stocks and bonds. Eventually, at the end of the payment cycle i.e. maturity (say 10 years), you will be paid the final investment corpus so long as you are alive at the time. Meaning, you don’t have to die to gain from your insurance policy making it very appealing to the average Joe.
Now most prudent financial planners will tell you ULIPs aren’t particularly useful. The cover is insufficient to really help your family in case catastrophe strikes and the investment bit won’t yield outsized returns considering that a sizeable part of your premium is deducted before they’re invested. But despite this sub-optimal allocation, customers always seem to think they’re getting a bargain. And the agents selling these products make sure of it.
But despite their popularity, ULIPs aren’t high-margin products. The real high-margin products? Standalone term insurance policies — where the payout only happens when you die. So HDFC Life would much rather have you buy these products as opposed to ULIPs. But as we already noted, this has never been an easy product to sell, until last year.
Now, most people think the pandemic would have been kind to the likes of HDFC Life. After all, this was the first time when a disease wreaked havoc on a truly national scale. Almost everybody had a close encounter with Covid-19 and common sense would have you think that this would prod people to insure their lives.
However, the first few months of FY21 didn’t exactly pan out as most people expected. Agents couldn’t visit their customers. Walk-ins vanished overnight and brokers had trouble conducting business online. Even though people began sensing the utility in buying a life insurance product, they still couldn’t make the purchase due to external conditions.
However, as the country began opening up, HDFC Life did witness an uptick in sales. Fear and general paranoia affected purchase behavior and what was once a push product became a pull product. HDFC Life’s revenue meanwhile shot up 140% compared to FY20. And while this number might seem incredible, do bear in mind that about 45% of the revenue was attributable to investment income (because of market conditions last year). Despite that, the company still witnessed a robust increase in premium income and everything was positive on the top line front.
However, the bottom line story was a bit different. Due to an uptick in claims, net profit only grew by about 5%. HDFC Life had to spend a lot of money settling these claims. And it gets worse. During the first quarter of FY22 i.e. the months between April and June 2021, HDFC Life paid out 70,000 claims totaling 1600 crores. That’s almost 3 times the sum they paid in the same quarter last year. They’ve also set aside an additional 700 crores for future claims that may accrue in subsequent quarters. All in all, this has had a visible impact on the company’s bottom line, which perhaps explains the current predicament.
We’ve finally got to a point where people are willing to buy life insurance policies. Not simply as an investment tool to save taxes, but to protect their loved ones in their absence. It’s an enviable spot to be in, however, it has come at a cost. The second wave and a future third wave could dent the bottom line even further. Unlike health insurance policies, where insurers have a lot of wiggle room to deny claims, life insurance policies are more watertight. If it’s a death claim, it's very hard to contest the payout. Insurers have little choice but to settle your claim. And that means they have to be very particular about the kind of people they insure.
Which is kind of what we are seeing right now. Insurers are now revising their risk underwriting guidelines. They are capping the maximum cover for certain groups of people based on their occupation and medical check-ups are now being made mandatory for most customers. So while there is a massive rush for pure protection high margin products right now, insurers also have to be extra cautious about the kind of risk they’re taking on right now. And if HDFC Life somehow manages to successfully navigate this tightrope, then perhaps these short-term results won’t matter as much for the company’s long-term ambitions.
After all, they're still one of the leading life insurers in this country.

https://finshots.in/markets/what-ails-hdfc-bank/,What ails HDFC Bank?,HDFC,"Despite healthy growth in revenues and stable asset quality, the bank which was once the darling of investors has been overlooked in favour of its peers. In 2021, it delivered a measly 3% return compared to nearly 40% by its rival ICICI Bank. And in today’s Finshots we see if there’s anything ailing HDFC bank.
The Story
In 1993, just a couple of years after the big bang liberalisation reforms, India’s banking regulator formally invited private players into the banking sector. Aftersorting throughover 100 applications, RBI decided to greenlight 10 applicants. The list included HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank (then known as UTI Bank) and they still continue to be the big banks of the modern era.
sorting through
But over the past two decades, one bank has towered above the rest despite starting off on equal footing — we’re talking about HDFC Bank. As of March 2021, it had a gigantic deposit base of over ₹13.3 lakh crore — 40% higher than ICICI Bank. And ₹6.15 lakh crore lying in current and savings accounts (CASA). Again, 40% higher than ICICI Bank.
In terms of market capitalization, it stands third in the country. Just behind Reliance Industries and Tata Consultancy Services. Its share price has grown by over 22% annually during the past 20 years — a feat that not many other stocks can boast of. It is also one of the most valuable brands in the world and a name synonymous with trust and reliability in India.
And the key reason for all this success? It did its job really well. That is to say that the bank continued to lend money and lend it to people who more often than not paid it back. During the glorious years, between 2004 and 2008, many banks prioritized growth above all else — lending to big businesses with faulty financials. HDFC Bank meanwhile prioritized prudence above all else.
Here’s one excerpt that should drive home this point
And if you remember anything from that period, you’ll know that Infra companies were some of the worst defaulters. Banks were piling on bad loans primarily because these companies couldn’t pay them back. And all these banks were forced to recognise bad loans that they had chosen to sweep under the rug. However, it was also a time when HDFC could truly shine. During the economic boom (between 2004–2008), HDFC grew at the same levels as most other private banks. But once the default rates picked up, HDFC grew at much faster rates than other private banks because a significant chunk of their loans was made out to the retail public — folks like you and me. They didn’t have to suffer the consequences of the bad loan epidemic and they continued to soar while other banks were left to pick up the pieces.
Unfortunately, the last 2 years haven’t been kind to the bank. Customers have bemoaned the frequent digital outages and even the RBI had to step in and force the bank to get its act together. The regulator meanwhile had also asked HDFC Bank to stop issuing new credit cards for almost a year and competitors had a field day during this time.
But there’s also something else that’s troubling investors. Something called “restructured loans”.
Think of it this way. During the pandemic, a lot of honest, god-fearing citizens couldn’t pay up their dues because the whole world came to a standstill. During such times, banks could do one of two things. They could tag them as defaulters and recognise that the loans may not be paid back (taking a hit on their balance sheet) or adjust the terms of the loan to make it easier for people to pay back over an extended period. The second option is called restructuring.
And according toBloombergQuint, HDFC Bank has decided to restructure loans worth ₹25,000 crores from the start of the pandemic till September 2021. Compare that to its competitor ICICI Bank which restructured only ₹7,900 crores worth of loans during the same period.
BloombergQuint
And the general consensus is that these restructured loans may pose a threat. They are likely to turn into bad loans considering the borrowers are stretched as is. And a recent report fromThe Morning Context drives home this point further by making a pertinent observation. Sure, the bad loans at HDFC Bank may still be the lowest in the industry, but if you add restructured loans into the mix, you’ll see that non-performing assets (NPAs) jump up to nearly 3.5% of the loan book. Those are the kind of numbers their competitors boast as well.
The Morning Contex
So, the question is — With the weight of these restructured loans hanging over its head, will 2022 be any different for HDFC Bank?
Well, to be honest, no one knows what will happen this year. But it’s likely that the 20-year legacy will count for something. Its experience in navigating multiple market cycles is priceless. It has a new CEO at its helm who has been with the bank since 1996. And considering the fact that most analysts still haven’t asked their clients to sell the stock, it’s likely that people are going to keep their faith. There’s also the fact that the stock is a lot more affordable right now (on a P/B basis).
And that means it’s entirely possible that HDFC may just rebound once again this year.

Alright we that out of the way, let's get to today's big story. It's about the merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank
The Story
“As the son grows older, he acquires the father’s business.”
That’s how Deepak Parekh, the chairman of HDFC Ltd explained the merger between the 45-year old HDFC Ltd and its 28-year old banking offspring HDFC Bank. And you know what? It’s a nice way of summarizing this merger (apart from the gender reference of course).
The point is — You can’t just look at this merger in the here and now. You have to rewind a bit and look at the historical relationship between these two iconic institutions.
So let’s go back to 1977. HDFC Ltd had just set up shop and it had one simple goal — to change people’s behaviour.
Wait, what? Isn’t HDFC the Housing Development Financial Corporation? A non-banking financial institution (NBFC)? What’s this nonsense about behaviour?
Well, 1977 isn’t 2022. If people wanted to build their own homes, they waited until retirement. They saved every penny. They were prudent with their spending. And they broke their provident fund. That’s how they built homes back in the day. Borrowing to build homes — That was a foreign concept. And HDFC wanted to change that.
So theyconvinceda certain D. B. Remedios to take out a loan of ₹35,000 to build a ₹70,000 home in Mumbai and thus began HDFC’s journey. This was their first customer andwithin a few years, the lender’s annual loan approvals had already breached the ₹100 crore mark. There was no looking back and HDFC became synonymous with home loans.

within a few years
But then we had the liberalization reforms in the 1990s. And this paved the way for something even greater.
At the time, public sector banks weren’t exactly the epitome of efficiency. They were weighed down by their legacy and people wanted a fresh banking experience — something more nimble. So HDFC made a pitch for a full-fledged banking license and HDFC Bank emerged as a result. As an added bonus, its chairman Deepak Parekh managed to convince Aditya Puri, who was heading Citibank Malaysia at the time, to jump ship and head the new banking upstart. The stage was set. This was HDFC Bank’s moment to shine.
But they didn’t exactly set the stage on fire the first year. In fact, the performance was quite disappointing. However, in itsfirst annual report, the bank decided to stick to its guns and talk about the company’s four values — operational excellence, customer focus, product leadership, and professional people. It wanted to gain people’s trust.
first annual report
And the rest, as they say, is history. HDFC bank quickly became India’s second-largest bank and people would automatically assume that the bank would grow 20% every year. It even found a place in the 100 mostvaluable brandsin the world.
valuable brands
The “child” had outdone the “parent”
And finally, after years of speculation, it seems to be happening. The two entities will merge into one and the $60 billion deal is going to create a financial behemoth of epic proportions. With HDFC Ltd’s assets thrown into the mix, HDFC Bank’s market share will jump from 11% to 15%. For context, India’s largest bank SBI has a market share of nearly 26%. This will also mean HDFC Bank will now be 2x the size of its nearest competitor — ICICI Bank.
So, how did it come to this? And why did HDFC Bank finally make an offer that its parent couldn’t refuse?
Frankly, the writing was on the wall.
You see, back inNovember 2020, an internal group set up by the banking regulator RBI had published a recommendation. It said that large non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) should consider turning into banks.
November 2020
Why did they make that recommendation? It was pretty simple really. Over the years, the distinction between NBFCs and banks had narrowed. In most cases, both these entities could accept deposits. And both of them could dole out loans.
Butregulations favoured NBFCs. They didn’t have to deal with as many restrictions and red tape. They had more leeway and time when it came to classifying bad loans. And this gave NBFCs an undue advantage over banks. Most of them grew at breakneck speeds and prioritized growth above all else. But this also came at a cost. Remember theIL&FS crisisfrom 2018? The company lent out a lot of money and couldn’t pay its creditors when push came to shove.
regulations favoured NBFCs
IL&FS crisis
And  when IL&FS blew up, everyone feared that the fallout would destroy the NBFC landscape. So the RBI decided to act. They tightened restrictions and put a new regulatory framework. Big NBFCs were now bound by similar regulations — the kind banks had always been dealing with.
So maybe HDFC feels there’s no point running a bank and another almost bank-like institution in parallel.
But there’s also another reason — a hiccup in the “home loans” business.
In a recent press conference Sashidhar Jagdishan, the CEO of HDFC Bank said, andwe quote: “The biggest motivation for the deal is creating demand in the housing market as our penetration in this segment is very low. We are losing our customers to other banks.”
we quote
See, banks love home loans. It’s the kind of loan that’s safe and sticky. After all, you always have the collateral — an actual home. And more importantly, demand for home loans was on the up. Unfortunately for HDFC Bank, they simply couldn’t participate in this line of business. HDFC was already doing it and so, all they could do was promptly assign (sell) these loans to HDFC and earn a small fee while at it. On the flipside, they could have earned so much more if they did everything themselves.
On the side, HDFC too had its own set of problems. For instance, banks can dole out cheap home loans because they can mobilize funds through deposits. They pay very little interest on your savings account and they can use these funds to then create home loans at a higher interest rate. Now even though HDFC wasn’t a bank, they could still access deposits. However, they couldn’t do it at the scale HDFC Bank was operating. So in effect, while HDFC Bank could mobilize funds at an average interest rate of say 4%, HDFC Ltd was doing it at 6%. That was their cost of borrowing. And naturally, it meant they had to charge prospective customers a higher rate of interest. And with this extra charge, their home loans simply weren’t going to be competitive as other banks — like Kotak Mahindra for instance.
A merger meanwhile solves this problem easy. The combined entity can now access deposits at a significantly lower rate of interest and they could be a real force of nature now.
But wait…we have to talk about the potential problems too, right?
Yes, we must. So let’s start with infrastructure lending then. Remember whenwe wroteabout HDFC and the uncanny way in which they sidestepped the implosion of debt-ridden infrastructure companies in the 2000s?
we wrote
Yeah, that story.
When HDFC Bank’s Executive Director Paresh Sukhthanka was asked about the company’s relative absence in the Infra space, he said and we quote — “It’s not that we haven’t participated in infrastructure. We have probably had a lower concentration of our loans in infrastructure. I’d say that risk management is also about deciding what you want to do and don’t want to do; be it with infrastructure or others segments and then doing it better… So I don’t think our strategy has been to avoid taking risks. I think we have been taking risks, when we have understood those risks and wanted to take those risks” — Forbes Interview, 2013
However, it seems they’ll probably change this strategy a bit. In fact, thepress releasesays so explicitly:“It will also enable underwriting of larger ticket loans, including infrastructure loans — an urgent need of the country.”
press release
So should investors worry about some of the risks involved? Maybe.
But there’s another problem.
Mergers aren’t always a silver bullet. A lot of mergers fail or they don’t quite work the way the top executives expect. It could be a people problem. It could be a systems problem. It could be a problem of cultures. Things can go wrong. In fact, the former CEO Aditya Puri may have held the notion that a merger may not entirely be fruitful for all parties involved.
So yeah, things could always take a turn for the worse, even when two stellar institutions come to join forces.
But will it actually happen? We will let you decide. What do you think? Will the merger bode well for HDFC Bank or do you think this will just slow them down?

On the side, HDFC too had its own set of problems. For instance, banks can dole out cheap home loans because they can mobilize funds through deposits. They pay very little interest on your savings account and they can use these funds to then create home loans at a higher interest rate. Now even though HDFC wasn’t a bank, they could still access deposits. However, they couldn’t do it at the scale HDFC Bank was operating. So in effect, while HDFC Bank could mobilize funds at an average interest rate of say 4%, HDFC Ltd was doing it at 6%. That was their cost of borrowing. And naturally, it meant they had to charge prospective customers a higher rate of interest. And with this extra charge, their home loans simply weren’t going to be competitive as other banks — like Kotak Mahindra for instance.
A merger meanwhile solves this problem easy. The combined entity can now access deposits at a significantly lower rate of interest and they could be a real force of nature now.
But wait…we have to talk about the potential problems too, right?
Yes, we must. So let’s start with infrastructure lending then. Remember whenwe wroteabout HDFC and the uncanny way in which they sidestepped the implosion of debt-ridden infrastructure companies in the 2000s?
we wrote
Yeah, that story.
When HDFC Bank’s Executive Director Paresh Sukhthanka was asked about the company’s relative absence in the Infra space, he said and we quote — “It’s not that we haven’t participated in infrastructure. We have probably had a lower concentration of our loans in infrastructure. I’d say that risk management is also about deciding what you want to do and don’t want to do; be it with infrastructure or others segments and then doing it better… So I don’t think our strategy has been to avoid taking risks. I think we have been taking risks, when we have understood those risks and wanted to take those risks” — Forbes Interview, 2013
However, it seems they’ll probably change this strategy a bit. In fact, thepress releasesays so explicitly:“It will also enable underwriting of larger ticket loans, including infrastructure loans — an urgent need of the country.”
press release
So should investors worry about some of the risks involved? Maybe.
But there’s another problem.
Mergers aren’t always a silver bullet. A lot of mergers fail or they don’t quite work the way the top executives expect. It could be a people problem. It could be a systems problem. It could be a problem of cultures. Things can go wrong. In fact, the former CEO Aditya Puri may have held the notion that a merger may not entirely be fruitful for all parties involved.
So yeah, things could always take a turn for the worse, even when two stellar institutions come to join forces.
But will it actually happen? We will let you decide. What do you think? Will the merger bode well for HDFC Bank or do you think this will just slow them down?

https://finshots.in/markets/reviewing-tata-motors/,Reviewing Tata Motors,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors just came out with its quarterly numbers for the new financial year and boy, was it disappointing. Revenue was down 25% compared to the last quarter* and the company posted a loss of 4,400 crores. And while most people would agree that this is no reason to celebrate, analysts still believe the company might hold potential.
But why?
Well, that’s what we want to discuss in this week’s Finshots Markets.
The Story
Let’s start with the domestic passenger vehicle segment. There was a time, not too long ago, when many people believed this was going to be Tata’s crown jewel. However, Tata Motors has struggled to gain a foothold in the passenger vehicle (PV) market, and in 2017, the chairman, N Chandrasekaran even admitted they were losing money on every car sold in India.
Having said that, however, things have been looking up for the division. Tata Nexon is a certified hit. Tiago is no slouch. Harrier holds potential and the recent spate of vehicle launches has breathed new life into the division. From around 3–4% in 2016, Tata Motors’ market share in the PV segment has doubled to 9%, making it the country’s third-largest carmaker today.
Not too bad eh?
In fact, the commercial vehicles (CV) segment has also seen some resurgence. Sure, Covid sucked the life out of the company for the first few months last year. But since then, there have been credible improvements on all fronts. Here’s an excerpt from the chairmantalking about the segment
talking about the segment
CV sales mirror economic growth. And the reduction in overall economic activity resulted in CV volumes dropping by 23.4% this year. Amidst a tough demand scenario, Tata Motor’s CV business posted sequential quarter on quarter growth on the back of improved consumer sentiment, buoyancy in e-commerce, firming freight rates and higher infrastructure demand.
And as the country begins opening up once again, commercial vehicle sales should start picking up rather quickly. In fact, by June 2021, commercial vehicle registrationshad already increased~230% compared to the same month last year, and guess who was leading the pack? Tata Motors.
had already increased
Then there is JLR — Jaguar Land Rover — the company’s UK-based subsidiary that brings in over 80% of the company’s revenue.
Back in 2008, when they acquired JLR for a whopping 10,000 crores, it was one of the biggest and the most ambitious acquisitions ever. JLR was on the verge of bankruptcy. But with Tata’s support, JLR scripted a rather impressive turnaround. From a consolidated loss of 2500 crore in FY09 to profits of over 14,000 crores in FY15, Tata Motors’ profits rose rather exponentially thanks primarily to JLR.
But then, things took a turn for the worse. The Brexit saga introduced uncertainties in the equation. Strict emission norms forced the company to make sweeping changes. And quality control became a massive problem.
Consider for instance China. For a population that craved expensive luxury vehicles, JLR was a godsend in many ways. And in 2014, the company started local production through a joint venture with Chery Automobiles. The idea was to modify the cars slightly to pander to local tastes while simultaneously avoiding the 25% tariff on imported vehicles. The move did wonders. China sales surged from ~100,000 in 2015 to ~150,000 in 2017. But with increasing volumes, customer complaints became more frequent. Product quality was a constant source of concern. There were defects with components ranging from engines, instrument panels, and airbags. The company had to recall some 106,000 vehicles from China. And eventually, the carmaker lost its sheen. While once China contributed almost a third of JLR’s sales, today its contribution has reduced to just 14% (FY20).
And all of this culminated in wasteful investments that failed to translate into meaningful opportunities. In 2018, JLR wrote off ₹27,000 crores in assets. That’s the company telling you these assets hold no real value and ought to be written off as a loss. Meanwhile, the company’s debt burden has been spiraling out of control — from ~₹33,000 crores in FY11 to ₹1.4 lakh crore in FY21.
Which is kind of the problematic bit here. Despite the fact that the domestic business is doing alright, JLR is still a massive drag on the company. In fact, as the pandemic made landfall, Tata Motors’ revenue fell by as much as 52%, thanks to JLR. In the first quarter of FY21, they made losses to the tune of 6,000 crores. And JLR had to act quickly. They adopted cost-cutting measures and laid-off employees. And while it was in fact an ugly sight at first, the company did start pruning losses. By September, they had already contained the leakage. By December, they were already posting a surprise profit. And considering China had begun opening up, there was a massive demand for luxury vehicles like JLR.
Don’t believe us? Just look at the order book — 110,000 units, the highest ever recorded in their history. The only problem is that they haven’t been able to meet customer demand owing to the semiconductor shortage.
So if the question is — “Why are analysts still optimistic about the company’s prospects despite the dismal numbers last quarter?” Perhaps this story gives you some sense of the potential upsides that could accrue to the likes of Tata Motors.” Having said that, however, the massive debt and the current financial numbers aren’t exactly to die for and so if you are taking a pessimistic view here, we wouldn’t fault you either.
Ultimately, you’ll have to make up your own narrative.
Until then…",0.17317525429525382
https://finshots.in/markets/what-went-wrong-at-tata-motors/,What went wrong at Tata Motors?,Tata Motors,"In this week's Finshots Markets, we talk about Tata Motors and an Act of God.
The Story
Last week, Tata Motors announced that it was planning to become debt-free in just three years. This ambitious target to pay back thousands of crores of loans obviously caught investor interest. But it also begets another more important question — How did Tata Motors get here? I mean, how did a legacy brand like Tata find itself in such a precarious spot.
Well, to understand the source of the problem, you have to go back in time.
Back in 2008, Tata Motors made a bold acquisition. It bought the struggling UK luxury car-maker,Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)by shelling out close to ₹10,000 crores and vowed to turn it around. Although the first year was a bit topsy turvy (considering the Global Financial Crisis), JLR soon started churning out big profits thanks to Tata Motors’ intervention. And I know we could talk about Nano or the company’s commercial vehicle segment before delving into this bit, but it’s JLR that’s the primary revenue driver for the company. So it’s imperative we take a closer look here if we want to isolate the real problem.
So what happened?
Well, for starters …
Brexit
Marketing your vehicle in a foreign nation might sound like a lucrative opportunity. But geopolitical tensions can upend this equation rather quickly.
Consider what happened in 2016. Britain finally decided it wanted to part ways with the European Union (EU). This meant the country had to rework its relationship with other members of the Union —on matters of trade, tariffs, free movement of people, all that stuff. For instance, back then, the EU contributed21% of all salesaccruing to JLR. The company, meanwhile, imported 50% of all its component from other countries in the Union. So friction between the UK and the EU had to have material consequences for both Tata Motors and JLR.
In fact, almost immediately after the first Brexit vote,the Pound fellby as much as 10% against the Euro. At the time JLR owed money to many entities in the European Union— payables for supplies and raw materials. However, as soon as the Pound began to lose value, JLR had to cough up a premium (more Pounds). In fact, they had to take a hit of ~₹2,300 croreson account of currency fluctuations alone. That’s quite steep!!
the Pound fell
Also, uncertainties surrounding Brexit began affecting the UK economy as well. Sales were down. Demand was lackluster and the company’s prospects began deteriorating rather quickly. But it didn’t stop at that. The problems just kept piling on.
A Switch to Eco-Friendly alternatives
JLR sold diesel cars. In fact, 90% of all cars sold in the EU were diesel variants. But after the Volkswagen emission scandal rocked the European Union, governments began to disincentivize the use of highly polluting fuels (including diesel) by ramping up taxes. This meant, JLR had to switch things up rather quickly. They began destocking diesel vehicles by offering massive discounts and made substantial investments in a bid to produce and promote more eco-friendly variants. And while this move was critical to their long term vision, it did weigh heavily on the company’s bottom line.
Elsewhere, JLR was having trouble with quality control. Consider China. For a population that craved for expensive luxury vehicles, JLR was a godsend in many ways. And in 2014, the company started local production through a joint venture with Chery Automobiles. The idea was to modify the cars slightly to pander to local tastes while simultaneously avoiding the 25% tariff on imported vehicles.
The move did wonders. China sales surged from ~100,000 in 2015 to ~150,000 in 2017. But with increasing volumes, customer complaints became more frequent. Product quality was a constant source of concern.
As one article in Automotive Newsnotes—
notes
And eventually, the carmaker lost its sheen. While once China contributed almost a third of JLR's sales, today it’s contribution has reduced to a meager 10%.
And all of this culminated in wasteful investments that failed to translate into meaningful opportunities. In 2018, JLR wrote off ₹27,000 crores in assets. That’s the company telling you these assets hold no real value and ought to be written off as a loss. Meanwhile, the company’s debt burden was spiraling out of control — from ~₹33,000 crores in FY11 to₹1.2 lakh crorein FY20.
And its prospects back home weren’t all too enticing either. Regulatory interventions affected sales of commercial vehicles — trucks, tempos etc. Economic woes affected domestic car sales. In fact, even the company’s chairman, N Chandrasekaranadmittedin 2017, that Tata Motors was losing money on every car sold in India.
admitted
And although the management has been desperately trying to prune costs and turn around the company, investors don’t seem very hopeful. The company’s stock price has lost 75% of its value over the past 5 years and the future still looks grim considering the UK government only recently refused to bail out JLR.
However, that being said, it wouldn’t be prudent to write off Tata Motors just yet. It’s an iconic brand. The company still has a strong product portfolio and they are in fact implementing cost-cutting programs in a bid to reduce that debt burden. And if Tata Motors does become debt-free within the next 3 years, maybe we’ll see another spectacular turnaround.
But how exactly will they go about it? That we do not know.
What do you think?
Do you think Tata Motors can make a comeback and if so, where do you see the upside?

https://finshots.in/archive/tata-motors-is-killing-its-dvr-shares/,Tata Motors is killing its DVR shares!,Tata Motors,"In today’s Finshots, we dive into shares with differential voting rights and Tata Motors’ decision to cancel them.
The Story
When a company issues equity shares, they’re trying to raise money. It could be to make an acquisition. It could be to finance day to day activities. Or companies may do it to repay existing loans and rid themselves of the burden of paying significant amounts of interest periodically. Equity money is pretty much perpetual in nature after all. They don’t have to ever return it.
But there’s a slight problem with equity shares. It dilutes ownership.
Say you own 1 out of 10 shares issued by a company. That’s 10% of the company in your pocket. If the company decides to issue 2 more shares and some third party laps it up, you now own less of the company — it drops to 8.3%.
And quite often, founders or promoters don’t like diluting their stake too much. They don’t like to cede control. Because once someone else owns a share, these folks usually have the right to vote too. The shareholders can choose to actively participate in management decisions. They can band together and scuttle the company’s plans to diversify or protest against increasing pay.
For instance, back in 2015, shareholders forced Maruti Suzuki to change its agreement with Suzuki Motor Company. The agreement chalked out details about setting up a new plant. Shareholders didn't like it and they voted against the proposal. In another case,shareholders votedto try and prevent Havells from paying a certain royalty to its promoter-owned groups. And a couple of years ago shareholders of Eicher Motors (Royal Enfield) voted against the reappointment of Siddhartha Lal as the MD too.
shareholders voted
Yeah, that can happen if promoters give away ownership.
Which brings us to Tata Motors.
In 2008, Tata Motors desperately needed money. It had borrowed this sum to buy British luxury brands, Jaguar and Land Rover. And then it wanted to get rid of the loan. So it decided to tap the equity markets to raise over ₹4,000 crores and repay the loan.
In 2008
But the promoters didn’t want to dilute their ownership. They wanted to keep control. So what did the automaker do?
Well, Tata Motors decided to issue a special kind of share — something called DVR share or differential voting rights share. The premise was simple. It wouldn’t offer the same voting rights as regular shares. It would carry only 1 vote for every 10 shares. And because it didn’t carry ‘equal’ rights, Tata Motors would sweeten the deal. The shares would come with an additional dividend. And it would also be issued at a discount to the regular shares. Back then shares of Tata Motors were trading at ₹340 a pop, but the DVRs were made available at ₹305.
So investors who didn’t care about voting rights but only cared about generating passive income through extra dividends swooped in. And Tata Motors raised crores without giving away too much control.
Sounds quite brilliant, no?
So they issued DVRs in 2008. And thensome morein 2010 and 2015 too. The promoters raised money and didn’t have to dilute their own voting power.
some more
And these types of shares have been quite popular in the US. Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google) and The New York Times have all issued differential shares or what they call Dual Class Shares (DCS). Heck, when social media firmSnapwent public in 2017, all the new shares they issued carried absolutely no voting rights. Which meant only founders and private equity investors would have any say in how the company was run. The IPO still garnered a lot of attention and people flocked to invest.
Snap
But unlike the US, DVRs simply never caught on in India. Even though such shares were permittedsince December 2000, just a handful of companies issued these shares. And maybe that was a problem. Maybe investors didn’t really understand what these shares were used for. So while typically these kinds of shares trade at a 5% discount to the main shares, Tata Motors' DVRs were almost always available at a 40–50% discount.
since December 2000
Now one reason could be that the big investors or the folks like mutual funds preferred to buy ones with voting rights. That way, they could intervene and vote if they felt the company was doing something foolish. And the retail folks simply didn’t understand what on earth was going on with DVRs. So most of them stayed away. Oh, and Tata Motors didn’t pay any dividends for a long time either so there was no added benefit here.
So the discount never vanished.
Either way, 15 years after first issuing these DVRs, Tata Motors has had enough. On Monday evening, it announced that it’s planning to cancel all these DVR shares. Yup, the company’s DVRs could stop trading within a year.
But here’s what Tata also did. It looked at the price differential between its two classes of shares — it was over 40%. And it said, “Look, we know you bought the shares hoping that the price differential would narrow. It hasn’t. So we want to do something about that. We’ll give you a 20% premium on the share price. We’ll give you 7 regular shares of Tata Motors for every 10 DVR shares you hold. It’s a sweet deal.”
Investors are happy.
But also, Tata Motors can smile too.
For starters, they won’t have the headache of managing two classes of shares now. And they won’t have to answer questions as to why there’s always a discount between the two. Also, since everyone will now trade only the main Tata Motors shares, it’ll improve liquidity. People won’t be confused as to which one to buy.
But it also does something else. A key metric that investors track will improve — we’re talking about the earnings per share (EPS).
Why, you wonder?
Think about it this way. Assume a company makes profits of ₹100. And the company has 10 DVRs and 10 regular shares available for people to buy. In this case, the total number of shares is 20. And the EPS is ₹5 (₹100/20).
But now, those DVRs will be exchanged for the regular shares. All 10 of them will disappear and get converted into 7 regular shares. That means the total number of shares will fall to 17. Meanwhile, the profit is still ₹100. And ergo, the EPS improves to ₹5.90 and looks optically better.
That could attract more people to invest in Tata Motors. And the demand could push up the stock price too.
So yeah, that’s all there is to it. And now you know about these Differential Voting Rights shares as well.
The only thing we don’t know is — “why now”. What prompted Tata Motors to act on this out of the blue? And if you have an answer to that, you know where to find us.
Until then…

Nearly 83% of Indian millennials don't have term life insurance!!!
The reason?
Well, some think it's too expensive. Others haven't even heard of it. And the rest fear spam calls and the misselling of insurance products.
But a term policy is crucial for nearly every Indian household. When you buy a term insurance product, you pay a small fee every year to protect your downside.
And in the event of your passing, the insurance company pays out a large sum of money to your family or your loved ones. In fact, if you're young, you can get a policy with 1 Cr+ cover at a nominal premium of just 10k a year.

https://finshots.in/markets/tata-steels-purple-patch/,Tata Steel’s purple patch,Tata Motors,"In this week’s Finshots Market we talk about why Tata Steel has been on a dream run these past few months.
The Story
Before we discuss the turning fortunes of steelmakers, perhaps it makes sense to revisit the predicament they’ve been dealing with the past couple of years.
2019 wasn’t a great year for steel companies. There was a general slowdown pervading all walks of life. Real estate wasn’t exactly booming. The auto sector was barely limping along and global factors weren’t kind to the likes of Tata Steel. In fact, demand for steel collapsed rather precipitously and prices reached a four-year low — the effects of which were readily apparent in the financial statements of steelmakers across the board. Tata steel posted losses in the last two quarters of FY2020 and JSW Steel saw its profits decline by a massive 90%.
And then, just when you thought things possibly couldn't get any worse, the pandemic made landfall. Domestic demand took a nosedive and they had to tap the export market to stay afloat. Luckily for them, an unlikely destination opened up — China.
China became the biggest buyer of Indian steel between April and September as they began opening up their borders after having dealt with Covid a few months prior. All in all,China alone accounted for 30%of the total exports during this period, and India for the first time turned into a net exporter of steel to China. Now bear in mind, this wasn’t exactly enough to turn the tide for Tata Steel. In fact, if anything revenues were still down 30–40% in the first quarter of FY2021 and the company continued to post losses.
China alone accounted for 30%
But it was a sign of things to come. And in the second quarter, their fortunes turned completely. Demand from domestic industries returned in a big way as people began splurging on automobiles, homes, and other steel products. Realisations jumped even higher as it became apparent that this was a global trend. Add to it the fact that raw material prices (iron ore prices) weren’t rising in tandem, steelmakers found themselves in an enviable position, They were roping in record margins and they were swimming in cash.
Then there was the China factor too. Most people know that China is notorious for producing cheap steel and dumping it on other countries. However this time around, they’ve been rather conservative. Why? you ask.
Well, China’s appetite for steel has been growing rapidly after the government introduced a stimulus package to kickstart the economy. They’re spending big on infrastructure projects and they’ve come to realize the need for inexpensive domestic steel. In fact, if anything they want to divert most of their products back home and as such, they’ve withdrawn export incentives on 146 steel products. Which if you haven’t already guessed, disincentivizes producers from shipping steel elsewhere.
Also, the Chinese government has continued to crack down on a number of polluting steelmakers in a bid to go green. As one report in Reuter’s notes —
“China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) urged top steelmaking city Tangshan to severely crack down on violations of atmospheric environment rules after it found four steel mills failed to implement production curbs during heavy pollution.”
And since this region alone contributes 10% to China’s steel output, the added pressure is also affecting industry dynamics. Bottom line — Without Chinese steel distorting prices, steelmakers elsewhere have been able to extract a much higher sum for their products. For instance, Tata Steel and JSW Steel are selling their products at Rs. 70,000/ton — a 100% hike compared to a year ago.
It’s crazy.
So why is Tata steel’s stock rallying you ask?
Well, because they’ve been posting exceptional numbers for a while now. Last December, the company earned its highest-ever operating profit. In the March quarter of FY21, they posted record net profits too. In the June quarter (Q1FY22), Tata Steel’s revenue jumped 109% and they earned a profit of 8,900 crores compared to a loss of 4,400 crores in the same period last year.
If this isn’t evidence of a purple patch, then we don’t know what is. Having said that, however, do remember that steelmaking is a highly volatile enterprise. The cycle peaks on some occasions and then bottoms out during others. And while prospects may look extremely pretty today, that can change pretty quickly if you’re not careful.
Until then…",0.08959262798961376
https://finshots.in/archive/tata-hakuna-matata-and-shitcoins/,"Tata, Hakuna Matata and Shitcoins",Tata Motors,"In today's Finshots we talk about Tata Coin and the wild wild west where shitcoins are born
The Story
A few months ago, Tata Sons approached the Delhi high court after stumbling upon a rather nefarious scheme. They were notified that two companies (based in the UK and US) were floating crypto tokens with the name $Tata. And while you may be inclined to think that this is an obvious play on the popularity and goodwill of the Tata brand name, things aren’t so straightforward here.
One of the accused in the matter ran a website called www.hakunamatata.finance and if you pay close attention to the name, there’s a “tata” involved at the end. Hakuna Matata also happens to be a phrase in the Swahili language — roughly translating to the words “no worries.” The phrase was made popular in the movie “Lion King” and as such, there’s another angle here worth exploring.
Tata Sons meanwhile argued that both companies engaged in the sale and purchase of this odd cryptocurrency by targeting Indian nationals. The whitepaper describing the $Tata cryptocurrency also makes a mention of a charity partner based out of India. And considering the website did attract an Indian audience, you could make a case that the court did have jurisdiction over the matter even though the companies weren’t based out of India. However, after much deliberation, the court argued that they wouldn’t interfere in the matter because Tata Sons couldn’t definitely prove through evidence that the companies intended to target Indian customers through their websites. As the judgenoted—“I do not find, in the aforesaid pages on the various social media accounts of Defendant 1, any intent, covert or overt, to target customers in Delhi. If at all they target customers, they target customers across the world.”
noted
And as such, Tata couldn't get the courts to side with them. But that’s not the story here. The story is about shitcoins — or cryptocurrencies that hold little to no value. These are coins marketed by a group of people trying to swindle investors of their hard-earned money. And like Tata coin, they almost always seem to follow the same playbook. A playbook that looks something like this.
Use a platform likeWavesto create a new coin. If you’re adept at this, you could wrap up the initial formalities in under 15 minutes. This should give you a sense of how easy it is to actually set up your own cryptocurrency.
Waves
Second and this is the most important bit. Pick a nice name. It doesn’t matter if it’s a play on “Hakuna Matata” or the “Tata brand name”, you have to pick a name that has a nice ring to it. You can also get creative here and use the names of other popular personalities if you so wish. Maybe a political leader or a famous cricketer. Go crazy with your imagination
Create a whitepaper describing the vision behind the cryptocurrency. Don’t worry —It doesn’t have to be precise so long as you make use of all fancy buzzwords like“PancakeSwaps.”And here’s the kicker — Nobody’s going to read it anyway. In fact, you don’t even have to write it yourself. Here are a bunch ofprofessionals on Upworkwho’ll write it for you and may I add, some of these rates look like an absolute bargain.
“PancakeSwaps.”
professionals on Upwork
Finally, you have to promote shitcoins if you intend to take them to the moon. Go on Reddit and make a thread about how this will change the world. Put together a telegram group and use lots of emojis as you hype up your newly minted shitcoin.
And once you have enough suckers buying into the idea, take all the money that people gave you so willingly and you can get away scot-free.
Simple. That’s all you have to do. And if all this seems too good to be true, let me assure you it’s not. Here’s what happened with a new digital token — Squid, inspired by the popular Netflix show Squid Game. The developers launched the new cryptocurrency after assuring people they’d launch a “play-to-earn” game modelled after the TV show and when enough people bought into the idea, they made off with close to $3 million. It’s crazy.
And if you’re wondering what happened to Tata Coin, well here’s a YouTube commentsummarizing that bit—“I went to my hakuna matata token on trust wallet when I was just checking all my tokens and saw that my investment in hakuna matata dipped by 90% lol.”
summarizing that bit
The comment also goes on to talk about a developer who swindled money while floating the project and it should come as no surprise that people who bought Tata Coin got the rug pulled from under their feet. They were scammed. So if you’re betting on some new cryptocurrency with a shiny name and an incomprehensible description, well, remember the playbook.
Remember how easy it is to make and market a shitcoin.

EVs
“An EV at your home would consume anywhere between 5-10 houses worth of electricity in one go. The way it works is that we all come home at 6-7 in the evening and try to charge our vehicles. So, there’s a peak load that happens at 6-7 pm,” Akshay Shekhar, Co-founder of Kazam, tellsYourStory.
These utilitycompanies approached Kazam’s Co-founder Vaibhav Tyagi, who had previously launched a solar energy company, Zunroof, to provide a solution to combat this problem and understand the load requirements to charge EVs.
“That’s how Kazam actually started,” Shekhar adds.
Founded in 2020, Bengaluru-based Kazam today operates charging stations in public spaces for the general public and quick commerce players. As an OEM supplier, it sells white-label chargers—which EV companies can sell under their brand—and software that helps consumers and operators keep track of their vehicle’s charge.

Building it up
Starting a YouTube channel helped Shekhar and Tyagi better understand the demand and needs of the EV industry. They realised consumers interested in buying EVs have done their homework.
The duo understood that India is atwo- and three-wheeler-dominant economy, and if one buys an EV, they can cut expenses, especially for these vehicles.

According to ICRA, penetration levels of electric two- and three-wheelers (excluding e-rickshaws) in India are expected to reach 6-8% and 14-16%, respectively, in FY25.
The duo started building charging stations and software to help connect them to the cloud. Once they understood who came to charge and the vehicle that needed charging, they could understand the electricity load balancing required and schedule the charging.
“You may not want to charge at 6 in the evening. You could even charge 10 or 2 in the night because you don’t need 12 hours to charge your vehicle. You just need two hours, and that can be scheduled. And, that will help the utility company do that,” Shekhar says.
Kazam’s software stack includesKazam CMS, Kazam FMS, and Kazam BSMS—each with a unique function.
Kazam CMS helps operators understand and monitor fleet charging, while FMS helps OEMs integrate help centres, finance, and fleet operations. Kazam BSMS monitors and controls battery health and offers geo-tracking and geo-fencing services.
The EV startup works with three private utility companies, including BSES Rajdhani, BSES Yamuna, and Tata Power, to solve this in Delhi. The company is creating more such use cases in other states.
It has also expanded its charging infrastructure service to nationwide fleet operators likeZypp, Mahindra Logistics, and Lightning Logistics.

However, fleet operators had a separate issue. Since their vehicles travel long distances, they must be charged overnight to ensure they are fully operational the next day.
Kazam solved this by adding a system where fleet operators could identify whether a vehicle was charged overnight for the next day’s delivery on a dashboard.
Besides its charging infrastructure and the software, Kazam also focuses on original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In fact, Bajaj Motors,Ather Energy, and Mahindra & Mahindra are leveraging Kazam’s chargers.

Today, when you buy a vehicle from any of these companies, Shekhar says, you get a Kazam charge point along with your purchase, which can be installed at your home.

Manufacturing
Kazam follows a manufacturing model similar to that of Apple.
“Apple has gone on to manufacture and create patent holders and designs in-house for all of them (Apple products). That’s exactly the model we have for our hardware. We have around 60-70 auto engineers who work on hardware tech and build the latest technology, design it, update it,” Shekhar explains.
Kazam has partnered with an India-listed company with global operations to help build its hardware. It has also joined hands with another manufacturer to help mitigate the risk of depending on a single manufacturer for the company. Shekhar declined to disclose their names.
The company imports about 10-12% of the product’s value from other countries, including the US, Germany, Singapore, Taiwan, and China. It sources the rest of the raw materials domestically, which allows Kazam’s OEM partners to take advantage of the government’s production-linked incentive schemes (PLI).
The road ahead
This year, Kazam introduced its new fast charging points—priced at a premium—which can charge two- and three-wheelers in 20-30 minutes. Its traditional charging points take 1-1.5 hours to charge a single EV.
Kazam has various charger models that can be used across vehicle segments ranging from the Mini, which is priced at Rs 7,999. The co-founder adds that the fast chargers are used more in public and commercial spaces, while traditional ones are used at home.
Meanwhile, Kazam signed an agreement with Malaysian government-owned energy company Petronas to expand its operations to Malaysia. It also plans to enter Thailand and Indonesia.
Shekhar adds that vehicle OEMs like Bajaj and Ather are looking to enter SAARC regions, which include Nepal,Sri Lanka, and other Southeast Asian countries.

“At this point, we have an AOP (annual operating plan) ready with these customers, but I cannot pinpoint the customer,” Shekhar says.
Kazam is also contributing to the Unified Energy Interface (UEI), which aims to create an ecosystem and help improve digital economic transactions between energy platforms. The initiative is powered by the Beckn Protocol, on which theONDC(Open Network for Digital Commerce) is also built.

Shekhar adds that consumers can expect a “very large launch” from UEI in October or November this year but did not disclose more details.
Besides, Kazam sells its EV software stack to about 15 countries. The startup is operational across 60 Indian cities, increasing its presence in Tier II and III cities.
“There are close to 5,500 pin codes that Kazam has been active on, and by the end of this 12 months, we should be close to 10,000 pin codes. Every month, we are adding anywhere between 4,000 to 4,500 charging points in India,” Shekhar adds.
Setting up infrastructure in Tier II and III cities is more challenging, as it’s difficult to find the right skills, get power supply, and supply raw materials, and Kazam is setting up a task force to address them.

Top-line numbers and funding
In the past 12 months, Kazam has grown about 8X-9X on a cumulative basis. It is trending toward $4.5 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) currently and expects around $6 million ARR by year-end. Shekhar adds that Kazam is expected to become profitable in the next 8-10 months.
According to him, the company’s revenue has grown 3X from FY23 to FY24.
It competes with Gurugram-based Statiq and Bengaluru-based Bolt.Earth in this space.
According to Tracxn, Kazam has raised $14.3 million in equity funding across eight rounds and had a post-money valuation of $23.8 million as of July 24.
It lastraised$8 million in a Series A round led by Avaana Capital Advisors and Vertex Ventures in August.

“When we moved in, and we decided we should invest early on in their journey, what really was for us was the fact that they had figured out a way to convince various stakeholders—be it the fleet companies, ecommerce companies, utility companies, charge point operators—to all sort of come on a common network,” said Swapna Gupta, Partner at Avaana Climate and Sustainability Fund.
Shekhar says the company does not need much capital. It might consider raising capital this year if it finds the right partner. “I think the winter wave has really taught us how to be in the market right now,” he says.
